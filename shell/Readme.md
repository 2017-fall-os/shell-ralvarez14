All bugs from part 1 are resolve, this is my first upload of piping may not work or be what is needed to be. I based myself from a webpage online.

gnu.org



Edit: for the second part of the lab I was able to create background process, and make executable simple comands; though i am cheching for "cd" command the function chdir() is not responding correctly and not changing directory, also if I dont say anfter chdir(); exit(1); then the program creates multiple processes that do not get destroyed. further more I was unable to pipe correctly. will have to work on this...


Edit 2: CD command bugs has been resolved, working fine; currently working on piping

Edit 3 [11/17/2017] : pipes and parameters for commands, as well as PS1 variable are working properly
